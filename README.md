## About

CUB3D is a graphic project from the 42 School curriculum that aims to introduce students to the concept of raycasting and the basics of game graphics programming. By using the miniLibX library, we create a simple game engine that renders a maze-like world using raycasting techniques.



## Features

- Explore a maze-like world in a 2D perspective.
- Move around using arrow keys.
- Display textured walls, sprites, and dynamic lighting.
- Customizable map layout via `.cub` files.
- Efficient raycasting algorithm for real-time rendering.



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cub3d.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd cub3d
   
3. Compile the project:
   ```sh
   make

4. Run the game with a provided .cub map file:
   ```sh
   ./cub3D maps/map.cub
